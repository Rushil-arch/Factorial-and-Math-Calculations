# Factorial and Math Calculations

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
This Python script defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using recursion. It returns the calculated factorial and calls the function with a sample number, printing the output.

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
This Python script asks the user for a number as input and uses the math module to calculate the square root, natural logarithm (log base e), and sine of the number (in radians). It displays the calculated results.

## How to Run the Scripts
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the scripts using Python:
   ```sh
   python task1_factorial.py
   python task2_math_calculations.py
